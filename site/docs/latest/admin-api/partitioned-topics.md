title: Managing partitioned topics
---

You can use Pulsar's [admin API](../../admin-api/overview) to create and manage partitioned topics.

In all of the instructions and commands below, the topic name structure is:

{% include topic.html p="property" c="cluster" n="namespace" t="topic" %}

## Partitioned topics resources

{% include explanations/partitioned-topic-admin.md %}
